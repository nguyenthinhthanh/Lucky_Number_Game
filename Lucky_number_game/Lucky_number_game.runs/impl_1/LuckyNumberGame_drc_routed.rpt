2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_controller_inst/special_m/rgb_reg[4]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_controller_inst/special_m/rgb_reg[4]_LDC_i_1/O, cell led_controller_inst/special_m/rgb_reg[4]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_controller_inst/special_m/rgb_reg[5]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_controller_inst/special_m/rgb_reg[5]_LDC_i_1/O, cell led_controller_inst/special_m/rgb_reg[5]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[2]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/O, cell led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[2]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell led_controller_inst/wingame/led_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
